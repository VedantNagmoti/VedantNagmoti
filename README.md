I’m an aspiring AI/ML Engineer passionate about turning complex ideas into real-world, impactful solutions. My expertise lies in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and AR/VR applications, with hands-on experience building projects that blend innovation with usability — from AI-powered virtual try-ons to environmental monitoring systems.

Currently pursuing my B-Tech in CSE (AIML) at VIT Pune, I’ve developed a strong foundation in Java DSA, Python, Django, and machine learning frameworks. I thrive in solving challenging problems end-to-end — from designing algorithms to deploying intuitive interfaces.

My work has earned recognition in national-level hackathons and competitions, where I delivered solutions that were not just technically sound but user-focused. Whether it’s predicting loan defaults with high accuracy or segmenting walls for realistic paint visualizations, I aim to create products that drive measurable impact.

I’m continuously sharpening my skills through LeetCode problem-solving in Java and building projects that bridge the gap between AI research and real-world deployment.
